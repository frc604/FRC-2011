FRC 2011 "Barracuda"
===================

This is [FIRST Team 604](http://604robotics.com/)'s 2011 robot code, rewritten from LabVIEW into C++ with the WPILib framework.

### "Special" Features

 - **Dual-mode arm control**, with manual and single-button PID-controlled preset modes, and a button to hold in the current position.
 - **Gyro-based driving**, with one button to face the robot forward, one to face it in the opposite direction, and one to reset the position that is considered "forward".

### Not-So-Special Features
 - Example of a custom PID Source and Output.
 - Example of basic drive code.
 - Example of compressor/pneumatics code.
 - Example of solenoid-based shifter code.
 - Control code for a single-jointed arm with a pneumatic gripper and rollers.
 - Control code for a pneumatics-driven minibot deployment system.
